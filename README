The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

sigrok-meter is a special-purpose GUI for libsigrok (written in Python + Qt)
which supports certain classes of test & measurement devices that usually
provide slowly-updating measurement values, such as multimeters or dataloggers.

It does specifically NOT support logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, and
mixed-signal oscilloscopes (MSOs).
